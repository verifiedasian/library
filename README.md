# Xiaohan's library Web Application
The project here was created for <b>The Odin Project</b> Javascript task - <b>Project: Library</b>.

I used Vanilla Javascript to create this project.

This project's task was for 'books' to be added to a library where these books can also be deleted, marked as read/unfinished, and be added to the library with the necessary information regarding the book such as pages read, author and title. 

The project aimed for the use and understanding of prototypal inheritance and constructor functions.

## Technologies
